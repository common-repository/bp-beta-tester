A plugin to switch between stable, beta or RC versions of BuddyPress.

== Description ==

BP Beta Tester provides an easy way to get involved with Beta testing BuddyPress.

Once installed it will help you to upgrade your website to the latest Beta or Release candidate. You will also be able to downgrade to the latest stable release once you finished your Beta tests.

Thanks in advance for contributing to BuddyPress: beta testing the plugin is very important to make sure it behaves the right way for you and for the community. Although the BuddyPress Core Development Team is regularly testing it, it's very challenging to test every possible configuration of WordPress and BuddyPress.

**!important**

Please make sure to avoid using this plugin on a production site: beta testing is always safer when it's done on a local copy of your site or on a testing site. And of course: **donâ€™t forget to backup before you start**!
